Abstract:
You've heard lots of hype about the Raspberry Pi, the credit-card sized
computer available for under $40. This talk will introduce some of the Pi's
features, explore some sample projects you can create, and show you how to
write code to control hardware through its IO pins. After this talk you will 
be ready to make your own cool hacking projects with the Pi.
